    # attribute/object access to a completed transaction will load from the most recent database state.
    expire_on_commit=True,
    # Itâ€™s also usually a good idea to set Session.expire_on_commit to False so that subsequent
    # access to objects that came from a Session within the view layer do not need to emit new SQL queries
    # to refresh the objects, if the transaction has been committed already.
