# Shared Kernel

The Shared Kernel is a pattern used in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) where multiple bounded contexts agree to share a common subset of the domain model. This shared part, known as the Shared Kernel, can include various elements, and it's typically meant to reduce duplication and inconsistency between different parts of the system.

Here's what the Shared Kernel might include:

1. **Common Domain Entities**: These are core concepts that are shared across multiple bounded contexts, such as common business entities that have the same meaning and behavior in different parts of the system.

2. **Value Objects**: These are simple objects that represent descriptive aspects of the domain with no conceptual identity, like Money or EmailAddress.

3. **Enumerations**: Commonly used enumerations that represent a static set of values used across multiple bounded contexts.

4. **Utility Functions**: Functions that encapsulate common logic or algorithms used across different parts of the system.

5. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: These define contracts that can be implemented differently in various bounded contexts but maintain a consistent structure.

6. **Data Types**: Common data structures or custom data types that are used in multiple parts of the system.

7. **Constants**: Shared constants that represent fixed values used throughout different bounded contexts.

8. **Validation Rules**: Common rules and constraints that apply to validation across different contexts.

9. **Integration Components**: If bounded contexts need to communicate with each other or with external systems, the Shared Kernel might include common integration logic, protocols, or APIs.

10. **Exception Handling**: Shared definitions of exceptions or error handling logic that applies across different contexts.

11. **Documentation**: The Shared Kernel should be well-documented to explain its purpose, how it should be used, and any rules or agreements regarding its modification.
